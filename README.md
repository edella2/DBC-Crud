### Build Something Beautiful & Meaningful

#### Learning Competencies
  * Building a web application from scratch
  * Managing the development process

#### Summary
You can choose whomever you would like to work with for this challenge. You can work by yourself, with a pair, or with a small group (max 4 students). 

You've learned a lot in phase 2: Sinatra, Active Record, JavaScript, Agile, and much more. Each of these tools is useful in its own right, but together, they give you something much more powerful — the ability to build a web application from nothing.

For this challenge, your assignment is to build something. It can be as practical or trivial as you would want, as long as it is a 100% functional, full-stack web application.

You can build anything you want, provided that it meets the following requirements:

- It has a database
- It uses an API (what does this mean?! explore!)
- It is styled
- It utilizes JavaScript
- It is deployed to Heroku

Once you've come up with an idea, get one of your teachers to approve it.
